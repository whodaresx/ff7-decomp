"""twins - find reusable code across overlays in a decompilation project.

Two kinds of sharing exist, and this reports both:

  1. Duplicated function bodies. The same function compiled into two different
     overlays. These are copy-paste-and-go: point at the solved one and the
     other is nearly mechanical.

  2. Call-level reuse. Overlays that do not duplicate any code but call shared
     helpers defined elsewhere. Magic's 200+ effect overlays are almost entirely
     this shape, so a byte-comparison alone reports them as empty.

This is a signposting tool ONLY, not a progress report. It answers "what can I reuse?"
and "where would work be useful?", it says plainly which overlays it could not
examine rather than passing over them.

Read-only: it never writes to src/, config/, or build/.

Offsets
-------
Overlays are not flat images, so file_offset = RAM - K where K differs per
overlay. K is derived from the overlay's own .s headers (each comment carries
"offset RAMADDR encoding") crosschecked against vram_start in the config.
main resolves to vram_start - 0x800 because it is a real PSX exe with a header;
overlays resolve to vram_start itself. Anything that fails the cross-check is
reported, not guessed at.

Normalisation
-------------
Two identical functions sitting at different addresses differ in branch
displacements, because those encode absolute addresses. Intra-function branch
targets are rewritten to an instruction offset from the function start; every
other operand, including external calls and global addresses, is left
byte-exact. Relaxing anything further was tested and found no additional
matches, only a risk of false twins.
